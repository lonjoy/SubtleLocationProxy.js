Proxy the location of one frame to the hash of another and vice-versa.

It's handy for sites that simply wrap a fancy UI around simple HTML pages.

1. Include the `SubtleLocationProxy.js` script[src] in your page (on the bottom, like normal).
2. Add the `data-history=proxy` attribute to an `IFRAME` element.
3. Enjoy the awesomenesses.


Browser Support
---------------

Tested in...

* Safari 5
* IE8
* Firefox 3.6

It'll probly work in tons of other browsers too.
